          <h2>Our tours are designed for the Avid Cyclist (You know who you are)</h2>
          <p>Black Bear Adventures bicycle tours are designed for the Avid or serious cycling enthusiast. This means that on a typical day you will cycle 50+ miles, climb in excess of 4000 feet and be in the saddle for 4+ hours. And although our tours are geared towards "Avid" cyclists we don't define avid by the pace you are capable of maintaining, it is demonstrated by a desire and capability to accept the challenge outlined above.</p>
          <p>We carefully design each tour and select each road to ensure the finest rider experience available... remember at Black Bear Adventures "It <em>IS</em> About the Bike”!</p>
          <p class="lead">Are you ready to accept the Challenge?</p>

          <h2>What We Do and Where We Go</h2>
          <p>We at Black Bear Adventures consider ourselves experts in the best cycling here in the south; from the <a href="/natchez-trace/">historic Natchez Trace</a> to the <a href="/blue-ridge-parkway/">Blue Ridge Parkway</a>, from the bayou to the bourbon trail and every desirable road in between.</p>
          <p>But while we are a bicycle vacation with an emphasis on the special cycling here in the south I have been lucky enough to have designed and led trips in 35 states thanks to both the <a href="/private-tours/">Private Tour</a> and <a href="/event-management/">Event Management</a> arms of our company. So don’t hesitate to come to us with an idea or desire to cycle somewhere outside of our core area of operation.</p>
